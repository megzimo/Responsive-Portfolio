      <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Megan, and I am a former science teacher looking forward to changing careers into technology.
        I have been learning how to code on my own for the last 4 months, and am so excited to be a member of the newest
        cohort at UT's Coding Bootcamp!</p>

      <p>Besides my newfound interest in coding, I am a food fanatic - baking and cooking are some of my favorite things to
        do. I am also a gardener, with raised-bed vegetable gardens along with a few flower beds. I love camping and hiking,
        and especially love visiting national parks.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to know more or are intersted in getting in touch with me, click on the "Contact Me" button to send me
        a message.</p>
